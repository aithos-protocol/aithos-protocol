# @aithos/data-backend — Changelog

## Unreleased — A2b vendor schema self-registration

### Added

- New DynamoDB table `aithos-data-pds-schemas-dev` (PK=`owner#<did>`,
  SK=`<schema_id>`) storing per-owner vendor schema documents (spec
  §3.7.3). On-demand billing, PITR on, single region.
- New JSON-RPC primitive `aithos.data.register_schema` —
  owner-only, idempotent on `(subject_did, schema_id, doc_hash)`,
  caps at 10 KB per doc / 50 schemas per subject.
- New JSON-RPC primitive `aithos.data.get_schema` (spec §5.5.1) —
  returns either a bundled core schema (no `subject_did` needed) or
  an owner-published vendor schema (lookup keyed by `subject_did`).
- New JSON-RPC primitive `aithos.data.list_schemas` (spec §5.5.2) —
  enumerates bundled core schemas, optionally filtered by prefix.
- New error code -32082 `AITHOS_DATA_SCHEMA_IMMUTABLE` — emitted when
  `register_schema` is called with an already-registered id and a
  different canonical document.
- `insert_record` / `update_record` now perform a two-tier schema
  resolution : bundled REGISTRY first, then the owner's vendor
  registry. Records under registered vendor schemas are now enforced
  server-side (`additionalProperties: false`, required, types).
  Pre-A2b "accept at face value" behavior is preserved for vendor
  schemas the owner has NOT yet registered.

### Internal

- `schemas/registry.ts` exposes `resolveSchema(id, ownerDid?)`
  (async) alongside the existing sync `getSchema(id)`.
- `schemas/store.ts` — new module with `getOwnerSchema`,
  `countOwnerSchemas`, `putOwnerSchema` + a 60-second LRU cache to
  bound DDB read amplification on the hot record-write path.

## 0.3.0-alpha.4 — 2026-05-14

### list_records filter support

The `aithos.data.list_records` handler now applies caller-supplied
filters server-side, matching the RFC §5.3.5 grammar:

- `equals: { field, value }` — exact match on any indexable field
- `contains: { field, value }` — substring on a string field
- `tags_any: [...]` — set membership (OR over tags array)
- `tags_all: [...]` — set membership (AND over tags array)
- `range: { field, gte?, lte? }` — bounded range on a string field
  (typically ISO timestamps)

Multiple criteria are AND-ed. Translated to DynamoDB `FilterExpression`
on the `gsi1_by_collection_mtime` GSI.

This unblocks the SDK's `client.data('contacts').list({ filter: { ... } })`
ergonomic API.

## 0.3.0-alpha.3 — 2026-05-14

### Gamma log is now persisted and verifiable (Sub-jalon 3.2c.2)

Every mutation on a subject's collections produces a signed entry in
a hash-chained audit log, queryable via a new RPC primitive.

### Added

- **New table** `aithos-data-pds-gamma-dev` (PK = `subject_did`,
  SK = `entry_id` ULID).
- **`lambda/gamma/store.ts`** — `appendGammaEntry`, `getHead`,
  `listEntries`, `verifyChain`. SHA-256 chain via `prev_hash`.
- **`lambda/gamma/hash-util.ts`** — `hashJson(value)` returns
  `sha256:<hex>` of JCS-canonicalized form. Used by handlers to
  commit to record / collection / CMK content without exposing it.
- **Gamma append wired into every mutation handler:**
  - `create_collection` → `data.collection.created`
  - `insert_record` → `data.record.created`
  - `update_record` → `data.record.modified`
  - `delete_record` → `data.record.deleted`
  - `authorize_app` → `data.collection.authorize_grantee`
  - `revoke_app` → `data.collection.revoke_grantee`
  - `rotate_cmk` → `data.collection.rotate_cmk`
- Returned `gamma_ref` now points at a real ULID-keyed entry (no
  more `gamma_pending_*` placeholders).
- **New RPC primitive** `aithos.data.list_gamma_entries` — owner-only;
  paginated; supports `op_prefix` filter and inline chain verification
  via `verify: true`.

### Entry shape

```json
{
  "id": "gamma_01J...",
  "at": "2026-05-14T07:30:14Z",
  "subject": "did:key:...",
  "op": "data.record.created",
  "payload": {
    "collection_urn": "...",
    "record_id": "...",
    "metadata_hash": "sha256:...",
    "payload_hash": "sha256:..."
  },
  "prev_hash": "sha256:...",
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "authored_by_envelope_nonce": "...",
  "authored_by_pubkey": "z6Mk...",
  "authorized_by": "mandate_..."  // only when delegate-authored
}
```

### Validated end-to-end

`test-e2e/gamma-flow.mjs` — 21 assertions, all green:

1. Collection creation emits `data.collection.created`
2-4. 3 inserts emit 3× `data.record.created`
5. Update emits `data.record.modified`
6. Delete emits `data.record.deleted`
7. `list_gamma_entries` returns 6 entries
8-12. Each op count is correct
13. `verifyChain` returns `ok: true`
14. First entry's `prev_hash` is the genesis sentinel
15. Every entry's `prev_hash` matches the previous entry's `hash`
16. Every entry carries audit metadata (envelope nonce + pubkey)
17. Every entry's `hash` is a well-formed `sha256:<64-hex>`
18. `op_prefix=data.record` filters correctly (5 entries)
19. Cross-subject snooping refused with 403 `AITHOS_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE`

Regression suites all green:
- `auth-flow.mjs` (3.2a) — 14/14
- `delegate-flow.mjs` (3.2b) — 11/11
- `schema-flow.mjs` (3.2c.1) — 13/13

**Total live deployment: 59 assertions all green.**

### v0.1 dev simplifications (documented)

- **No per-entry Ed25519 signature.** The spec asks for each entry to
  be signed by either a sphere key (subject direct) or a delegate
  key (with `authorized_by` mandate id). v0.1 dev relies on the
  envelope signature instead: `authored_by_envelope_nonce` provides
  the audit trace back to the verified-and-replay-protected envelope
  that produced the entry. A future Sub-jalon adds full per-entry
  signing per spec §10.5.
- **Concurrency.** Concurrent appends on the same subject may both
  read the same head before either commits, producing a chain fork.
  In practice ULIDs prevent silent collision (the second commit's
  ULID is later) but `verifyChain` will then report the fork. Future
  Sub-jalon adds compare-and-swap on a head pointer attribute.
- **Eth / data gamma fusion.** Per spec §8.2, a subject's Ethos and
  data mutations share a single logical chain. v0.1 keeps them in
  separate tables (and thus separate chains) for clarity. Fusion is
  a future protocol-level decision.

## 0.3.0-alpha.2 — 2026-05-14

### Schema validation is now real (Sub-jalon 3.2c.1)

The PDS now validates every `insert_record` and `update_record`
against the registered schema. `create_collection` rejects collections
referencing an unknown `aithos.*` schema. Records that violate the
schema are rejected with `-32072 AITHOS_DATA_RECORD_INVALID` before
storage.

### Added

- **First normative core schema** `aithos.contacts.v1`:
  - Spec: `spec/data/schemas/aithos.contacts.v1.md`
  - JSON Schema: `spec/data/schemas/aithos.contacts.v1.json`
  - Bundled in Lambda: `lambda/schemas/aithos.contacts.v1.ts`
  - Fields: 9 indexable (`name`, `email`, `phone_hash`, `status`,
    `tags`, `source`, `created_at`, `modified_at`,
    `last_contacted_at`) + 5 encrypted (`phone`, `notes`,
    `conversation_log`, `form_responses`, `custom_fields`).
- **Schema registry** (`lambda/schemas/registry.ts`):
  - `getSchema(id)`, `listSchemas()` for lookup.
  - `validateMetadata(schemaId, metadata, { op })` returns
    `{ ok, errors, metadata }` with cleaned values.
  - Hand-rolled JSON Schema 2020-12 subset (no ajv dep, keeps bundle
    lean).
  - Enforces `aithos:auto: on_insert | on_modify` — client-supplied
    values are silently overridden.
  - Rejects fields marked `aithos:encrypted` from showing up in the
    `metadata` payload (they belong inside the encrypted blob).
  - Applies `default` values for missing optional fields.

### Validated end-to-end

`test-e2e/schema-flow.mjs` — 13 assertions, all green on live:

1. Unknown schema in create_collection → `-32070 SCHEMA_UNKNOWN`
2. Valid `aithos.contacts.v1` collection created
3. Missing required `name` → `-32072 RECORD_INVALID`
4. Wrong type for `tags` (string vs array) → `-32072`
5. Status not in enum → `-32072`
6. Bad email format → `-32072`
7. Encrypted field `phone` placed in metadata → `-32072`
8. Unknown field → `-32072`
9. Bad `phone_hash` pattern → `-32072`
10. Valid full record → 200
11. Client `created_at` silently overridden (auto:on_insert)
12. Server-set `created_at` differs from the spoof value
13. Default `status: "lead"` applied when omitted

Regression suites still green:
- `auth-flow.mjs` (3.2a) — 14/14
- `delegate-flow.mjs` (3.2b) — 11/11

**Total live deployment: 38 assertions all green.**

### Known limitations (deferred)

- Only `aithos.contacts.v1` is bundled. Other core schemas
  (`aithos.messages.v1`, `aithos.calendar.v1`, …) are deferred to
  later jalons.
- Third-party schemas (any prefix outside `aithos.*`) are accepted at
  face value in `create_collection` and skip server validation. Client
  is expected to validate.
- No anonymous `aithos.data.get_schema` / `list_schemas` RPC yet —
  apps that want to read schemas dynamically must bundle them.
- `did:aithos:…` resolution and gamma log persistence remain deferred
  to Sub-jalon 3.2c.2 / 3.2c.3.

## 0.3.0-alpha.1 — 2026-05-14

### Delegate flow is now real (Sub-jalon 3.2b)

Owner can mint a mandate, authorize an app to act on their data, and
revoke that mandate. The app authenticates via its own grantee key
while presenting the subject's mandate. Scope is enforced
per-operation. Revocations are persisted and consulted on every
envelope verification.

### Added

- **Three new handlers** (`lambda/handlers/authorization.ts`):
  - `aithos.data.authorize_app` — owner adds a CMK wrap for a new
    grantee, attaches the signed mandate document, indexes the
    mandate on the collection.
  - `aithos.data.revoke_app` — owner removes the grantee's wrap,
    records the revocation in the dedicated table, optionally rotates
    the CMK and accepts re-wrapped DEKs for forward secrecy.
  - `aithos.data.rotate_cmk` — owner-driven CMK rotation independent
    of any revoke (e.g. periodic hygiene).
- **New table** `aithos-data-pds-revocations-dev` — primary key
  `mandate_id`, queried on every authenticated request whose envelope
  carries a mandate.
- `findRevocation` wired into the envelope verifier context. A
  revoked mandate now fails verification with `-32041 AITHOS_MANDATE_REVOKED`.
- DID resolver enhancement: `did:key:…` resolution exposes the
  Ed25519 key under sphere aliases (`#public`, `#circle`, `#self`) so
  Aithos mandates whose `issued_by_key` ends in `#public` verify
  against did:key issuers. Pragmatic accommodation until full
  `did:aithos:…` support arrives.

### Validated end-to-end

`test-e2e/delegate-flow.mjs` — 11 assertions, all green on the live
deployment:

| # | Step | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Owner creates collection | ✓ |
| 2 | Owner mints WRITE mandate for app A | ✓ |
| 3 | `authorize_app(mandate_A, wrap_A)` | ✓ |
| 4 | App A `insert_record` (mandate-signed envelope) | ✓ |
| 5 | App A `update_record` | ✓ |
| 6 | App A `get_record` (write implies read) | ✓ |
| 7 | Owner mints READ-only mandate for app B and `authorize_app` | ✓ |
| 8 | **App B `insert_record` → 403 `AITHOS_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE`** | ✓ |
| 9 | App B `get_record` | ✓ |
| 10 | `revoke_app(mandate_A)` | ✓ |
| 11 | **App A `get_record` after revoke → 403 `AITHOS_MANDATE_REVOKED`** | ✓ |

Regression suite (`test-e2e/auth-flow.mjs` from 3.2a) — 14/14 still green.
**Total: 25/25 on the deployed stack.**

### Known limitations (deferred to Sub-jalon 3.2c)

- `did:aithos:…` resolution remains stubbed. did:key only.
- Schema validation of records against `aithos.contacts.v1` etc. is
  not enforced yet.
- Gamma log persistence is still a placeholder `gamma_pending_<ts>`.
- CMK rotation accepts re-wrapped DEKs but doesn't validate the wrap
  cryptographically — the platform trusts the owner client to produce
  correct wraps.
- The `actor_sphere` field of mandates uses the existing
  `public | circle | self` enum from protocol-core. The spec's
  `actor_sphere: "data"` value will need a protocol-core enum
  extension, deferred.

## 0.2.0-alpha.2 — 2026-05-14

### Authentication is now real

Sub-jalon 3.2a — envelope verification + mandate verification +
anti-replay are in place. The PDS no longer accepts any operation
without a valid signed envelope.

**Anyone holding only a DID cannot read or write anything.**

### Added

- `lambda/auth/did-resolver.ts` — `did:key:…` resolution (offline, deterministic).
  Synthesizes a `DidDocument` shape compatible with `@aithos/protocol-core`.
- `lambda/auth/nonce-store.ts` — DynamoDB-backed replay cache,
  atomic `PutItem` with `attribute_not_exists`, native DDB TTL on
  `expires_at_epoch`.
- `lambda/auth/authenticate.ts` — middleware that runs the 9-step
  `verifyEnvelope` from `@aithos/protocol-core` before every handler.
  Returns a typed `Caller { subjectDid, mode, mandateId?, mandate?,
  signerPubkeyMultibase, params }`.
- `requireScope(caller, collection, action)` — enforces
  `data.<col>.<action>` (with `data.*.<action>` and admin wildcards)
  per spec §4.
- `requireSubjectMatch(caller, target)` — rejects a caller whose
  `envelope.iss` doesn't match the target subject.
- **New table** `aithos-data-pds-nonces-dev` — replay-protection store,
  TTL-managed.
- **New handlers** `update_record` and `delete_record`. Both require
  `data.<col>.write` scope. `delete_record` supports optional
  `hard_delete: true` (owner-only).
- HTTP status mapping in router: `-32010..-32013` → 401,
  `-32040..-32042` → 403, `-32020` → 404, `-32601` → 404.

### Validated end-to-end

`test-e2e/auth-flow.mjs` covers a full lifecycle on the deployed
endpoint with a real signed envelope:

| Assertion | Result |
|---|---|
| `create_collection` (owner-signed) | 200 ✓ |
| `insert_record` (owner-signed) | 200 ✓ |
| `list_records` returns 1 item | ✓ |
| `get_record` returns the record | ✓ |
| `update_record` persists changes | ✓ |
| `delete_record` (soft) | 200 ✓ |
| `get_record` after delete | 404 ✓ |
| **No envelope → 401 `AITHOS_BAD_ENVELOPE`** | ✓ |
| **Tampered signature → 401 `AITHOS_BAD_SIGNATURE`** | ✓ |
| **Method mismatch → 401 `AITHOS_BAD_ENVELOPE`** | ✓ |
| **Replayed nonce → 401 `AITHOS_REPLAY_DETECTED`** | ✓ |
| **`envelope.iss` ≠ `subject_did` → 403 `AITHOS_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE`** | ✓ |

### Known limitations (deferred to Sub-jalon 3.2b)

- **DID method support.** Only `did:key:…` resolves locally. `did:aithos:…`
  is deferred to 3.2b (will require an HTTP fetch to the Ethos
  platform endpoint plus an in-memory cache).
- **Revocation lookup.** `findRevocation` in the envelope verifier
  context is omitted in v0.1 dev. Mandates are accepted as long as
  their signature and time window check out. Revocation handling
  arrives with the `authorize_app` / `revoke_app` handlers in 3.2b.
- **Missing handlers.** `authorize_app`, `revoke_app`, `rotate_cmk`
  remain in Sub-jalon 3.2b.
- **Schema validation** against `aithos.contacts.v1` (and other core
  schemas) — Sub-jalon 3.2c.
- **Gamma log** persistence + chain check — Sub-jalon 3.2c.

### Security note

- The replay cache uses an atomic `PutItem(condition: attribute_not_exists)`.
  A nonce is committed exactly once. A second use of the same nonce
  fails the conditional and returns `-32012`.
- Replay cache outages **fail closed** — if DynamoDB is unreachable
  for the nonce check, the request is rejected with `-32603` rather
  than allowed through.
- Envelope TTL is bounded by the protocol-core verifier to
  `[1, 300]` seconds.
- The audience check binds each envelope to the exact endpoint URL it
  was submitted to. An envelope signed for `/mcp/primitives/read`
  cannot be replayed against `/mcp/primitives/write` even within its
  TTL window.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-05-14

Initial MVP. See README §"What's implemented" for the initial handler
set. Auth was stubbed. Superseded by 0.2.0-alpha.2.
